# ARID1A-Mediated Resistance in Melanoma: Multi-Omics Analysis

In this repository is the code to explore **ARID1A-driven resistance mechanisms** in melanoma treated with BRAF and MAPK inhibitors. This repository contains the code integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and kinomics to identify key signaling pathways and resistance mechanisms using **network-based analysis**.

## Overview

This project examines the signaling and immune dynamics underlying drug resistance in melanoma in the context of ARID1A loss. Using **graph-theoretical and matrix factorization approaches**, the study uncovers actionable resistance pathways.

### Key Findings:
- **ARID1A-KO cells** sustain MAPK1/3 and JNK signaling post-treatment, bypassing feedback mechanisms.
- Resistance is mediated by **elevated RTK activity** (e.g., EGFR, ROS1), disruption of PKC dynamics, and JUN activation.
- ARID1A KO elicits immune evasion through reduced HLA expression and enriched extracellular matrix proteins.
- ARID1A KO function feeds through critical signalling nodes: **PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1**.
